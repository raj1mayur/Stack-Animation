<h2 align="center"><strong>What I Have Learned from This Project:</strong></h2>

<h4><strong>1. Git</strong></h4>
   - Proficiency in cloning Git repositories.
   - The process of pushing changes from a local device to the main branch.
   - The importance of executing 'Git Push' at the start of each workday to ensure both remote and local branches are up-to-date.
   - Recognition that if the email settings on GitHub are configured to "Block command line pushes that expose my email," this setting may prevent pushing changes to the main branch from a local repository due to email exposure.

<h4><strong>2. React</strong></h4>
   - Establishing a well-organized folder structure for creating components and incorporating images.
   - The value of adding comments, even for minor details, as they can prove highly beneficial when reviewing the project retrospectively.
