I have a conceptual idea that I am actively pursuing. In order to actualize this concept, I am in the process of crafting custom components for each developmental stage. While the animations I have created thus far may not exhibit flawless execution, my primary objective is to bring my imaginative vision to life and assess its feasibility. Once the initial phase is completed, I intend to refine these components. Presently, CSS has been employed for the animation, although I am contemplating transitioning to JavaScript and Three.js for the final animation sequences.
