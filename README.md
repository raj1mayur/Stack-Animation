# Stack-Animation
I have a idea in my mind. To implement it , I am making custom components for every step. 
Nothing in those animations is perfect . just want my imagination in front of me to know if it possible to go to the final output.
Once I will be done , I will then improve those components.
Currently their is css used for animation , but I am thinking of going with js and three.js for the final animations.
